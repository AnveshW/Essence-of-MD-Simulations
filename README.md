# MD Simulations of RNA molecule and Protein Complex
Here I will give a step by step methodology on how to simulate an "8vfs" and "NSP3 complex". 8vfs is a "oppF ROSE-like RNA thermometer structure". RNA thermometers are regulatory RNA elements that modulate gene expression in response to temperature changes. The NSP3 complex is a protein complex that plays a crucial role in viral replication and host interaction in some viruses, particularly coronaviruses. This will include Energy minimization, Heating of complexes, Taking system to equilibrium stage, RMSD, RMSF, RG, Hydrogen Bonding, Cluster analysis, Salt bridge analysis, Linear Interaction Energy,  Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) etc.
