# MD Simulations of RNA molecule and Protein Complex
Here I will give a step by step methodology on how to simulate an "8vfs" and "NSP3 complex". 8vfs is a "oppF ROSE-like RNA thermometer structure". RNA thermometers are regulatory RNA elements that modulate gene expression in response to temperature changes. The NSP3 complex is a protein complex that plays a crucial role in viral replication and host interaction in some viruses, particularly coronaviruses. We will study RMSD, RMSF, RG, Hydrogen Bonding, Cluster analysis,etc.
