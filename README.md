# MD Simulations: 
I learned how to simulate protein complexes, protein-ligand complexes. This repository contains differenet proteins and protein complexes with the associated files which I have been working on. This repository contains some complexes on which I have performed computational calculation tasks such as Energy Minimization, Heating of Complexes, System Equilibration, Structural and Interaction Analysis: RMSD, RMSF, Radius of Gyration, Hydrogen Bonding, etc.
This repository is under work and will be updated with remaining files as soon as possible.

P.S. Since my primary interest lies in genome editing I am currently reading on simulations of sgRNA's with different Cas Proteins, trying to check the stability of compounds, and increasing overall accuracy of sgRNA-Cas9 complex.

# The workflow includes the following stages:
- Energy Minimization
- Heating of Complexes
- System Equilibration
- Structural and Interaction Analysis: RMSD, RMSF, Radius of Gyration, Hydrogen Bonding, Cluster Analysis, Salt Bridge Analysis
- Energy Calculations: Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA)
  
# Tools and Pre-Requisites
The following tools are required for performing simulations and analyzing data:
- Protein Data Bank (PDB)
- SPDBV
- VMD
- NAMD
- Biovia Discovery Studio
- GROMACS
- Vega ZZ
- Chimera
- Notepad++
- Microsoft Excel
