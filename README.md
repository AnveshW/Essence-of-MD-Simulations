# MD Simulations of RNA molecule and Protein Complex

This repository provides a detailed step-by-step methodology for simulating the 8vfs RNA molecule and the NSP3 protein complex. These simulations aim to study the structural dynamics and functional interactions of these macromolecules.
8vfs: A "oppF ROSE-like RNA thermometer structure." RNA thermometers are regulatory RNA elements that modulate gene expression in response to temperature changes.
NSP3 Complex: NSP3 is a multifunctional protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

# The workflow includes the following stages:
- Energy Minimization
- Heating of Complexes
- System Equilibration
- Structural and Interaction Analysis: RMSD, RMSF, Radius of Gyration, Hydrogen Bonding, Cluster Analysis, Salt Bridge Analysis
- Energy Calculations: Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA)
  
# Tools and Pre-Requisites
The following tools are required for performing simulations and analyzing data:
- Protein Data Bank (PDB)
- SPDBV
- VMD
- NAMD
- Biovia Discovery Studio
- GROMACS
- Vega ZZ
- Chimera
- Notepad++
- Microsoft Excel
